## GiggleTouch Sample

This code is the result of [NSScreencast Episode 114](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/114-playing-sounds-with-sprite-kit). In the video I
used sound effects and music that I purchased a license to.  As such, I cannot post the actual audio contents here.

I've replaced the sound effects with free sounds from the following sources:

* Laugh Sound Effects - [Shockwave-Sound](http://shockwave-sound.com)
* Background Music - [Playonloop](http://playonloop.com)

If you'd like to purchase your own, high quality audio files, I recommend [Audio Jungle](http://audiojungle.net).
